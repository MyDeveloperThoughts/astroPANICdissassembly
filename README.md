# Astro-PANIC Dissassembly
## About
This is still a work in progress.  
The first video was released on 8/31/2025.  
https://youtu.be/HprpKnJW7kg


The d64 images were uploaded in the order in which progress was made while I was making the video.  
Files 1 through 5 are from the first video.


The individual d64 images are snapshots of the evolution of the source code as it was being disassembled in the video.  
The file **astro-latest-sourcecode** is the real time latest version as I am still disassembling.
