Code Flow:
ORG $C000

Jump to Start

Install IRQ:
    Disables default int CIA timer
    Installs a raster IRQ at 0314 for raster line 233
    rts

Raster IRQ:
    (VIC CHIP BANK 0  DD00-   Char Rom: $1000-$1FFF)
    Bottom part of screen (Raster 233+)
      VIC Set to standard 40 col text mode
      CharData: 1800   Screen: 0400 (1000 is normal rom, 1800 is reverse chars rom)
      Border + Screen medium grey
      RTI

    Top part of screen (Raster 0+)
      VIC Set to multicolor 40 col text mode
      CharData: 3800   Screen: 0400
      Border + Screen black
      If not paused (Shift Key not pressed)  RTI

      Set Players Sprite X Position
           Set sprite 0 to DATPLAYERX (bits 0-7) $D000
           Load to Accumulator all sprites bit 8 ($D010)
           AND it with FE (11111110)
           Then or it with DATPLAYERX8 to set our cannon position

      Read $DC00 / Is the fire button pressed?
      Nope - Exit IRQ
      If it is pressed, EXIT IRQ if a bullet is already in flight   HC658 = DATBLTMV

      Translate the position of the bulletr from the Sprite x (0-319) to character x (0-39)
      Calculate the screen ram address and color ram address of the bullet and store in FBFC FDFE
      EXIT IRQ

Start:
   JSR InstallIRQ
   ...
   HC1F1 Loop through the seven saucers
       Set all Y positions to 0  (C65C 0-6) DATSAUCERY)   Sprite Y positions for saucers
       Set all X positions to ?+31 (C65B 0-6 DATSAUCERX)  Sprite X positions for saucers
       (Where does the 8th bit go I wonder?)

   HC21E Seems to be the main game loop
      Check if Cannon hit a sprite
      If so, jmp to HC3E6 = LOSELIFE (This is probably the explosion logic)


Data: (C65A and up)
DATPLYRX  = $C659 (Cannon X position bits 0-7)
DATSPRT8  = $C65A (All Sprites bit 8)
DATNOPAUSE = $C689
            Initially set to 0
            If 1 = the IRQ Handler will ignore the shift key to pause logic
            Seems to be a flag if we should honor the shift key down / pause idea
DATLEVEL   = $C68B
            Current level of the game.  Starts 15 and goes down.
            When printed, it is XORed with 15 so it prints starting at 0 and goes up to 15



Sprite Shapes:
  232 E8 = Cannon
  233 E9 = Saucer
  234 EA = Explosion
  235 EB = Cannon 2
