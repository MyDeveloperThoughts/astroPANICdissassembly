Install IRQ:
    Disables default int CIA timer
    Installs a raster IRQ at 0314 for raster line 233
    rts

Raster IRQ:
    (VIC CHIP BANK 0  DD00-   Char Rom: $1000-$1FFF)
    Bottom part of screen (Raster 233+)
      VIC Set to standard 40 col text mode
      CharData: 1800   Screen: 0400 (1000 is normal rom, 1800 is reverse chars rom)
      Border + Screen medium grey
      RTI

    Top part of screen (Raster 0+)
      VIC Set to multicolor 40 col text mode
      CharData: 3800   Screen: 0400
      Border + Screen black
      If not paused (Shift Key not pressed)  RTI

      Set Players Sprite X Position
           Set sprite 0 to DATPLAYERX (bits 0-7) $D000
           Load to Accumulator all sprites bit 8 ($D010)
           AND it with FE (11111110)
           Then or it with DATPLAYERX8 to set our cannon position

            Read $DC00 ?

Data: (C65A and up)
DATPLYRX  = $C659 (Cannon X position bits 0-7)
DATSPRT8  = $C65A (All Sprites bit 8)
DATNOPAUSE = $C689
            Initially set to 0
            If 1 = the IRQ Handler will ignore the shift key to pause logic
            Seems to be a flag if we should honor the shift key down / pause idea
DATLEVEL   = $C68B
            Current level of the game.  Starts 15 and goes down.
            When printed, it is XORed with 15 so it prints starting at 0 and goes up to 15
